# Introduction
The near decade requires science and technology in multiple fields. With the booming development of technology and the elevating public demand for better living condition, the smart home industry has attained a significant profit and a decent growth rate.
In this project, we wish we can design a smart home system to serve the olderly who live alone. All the devices were made with Arduino and could realise the serving goal.

# Soil Mositure Detector
It is healthy for the elderly to have one or two plants at home. But they may suffer from watering on time because of their declining memories. This device can detect the resistor of the soil and remind them to water the plants.

# Smart Power Strip
Remote control of the power strip can enhance the convenience and security of the elderly. The Smart Power Strip has two control modules. With Wi-Fi control
module, the elderly can operate the electrical devices through wireless information transmission anywhere. The initial embedded module enables to collect the data of the environment in real time to decrease the risk of catching fire.

#Smart Clothes Rack and Curtain
People tend to come across inconvenient situations when the clothes are hung up outside but inaccessible at rainy days, or the clothes are indoor with a shiny sunlight. The demand of a weather controlled clothes rack which has the automatic collecting function both to prevent the clothes from being drenched and to better exploit the sunlight. The core components of the smart clothes rack include a light sensitive sensor and a motor. When the sensor detects the sunlight above a certain level, the clothes rack will be stretched to exploit the sunlight, while the rack will be pulled back when the sunlight below a certain rate. Manually push the button will also be available for pulling back the rack.
